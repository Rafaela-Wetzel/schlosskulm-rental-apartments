# Code Institute: Full Stack Project by Rafaela Wetzel

The fourth milestone project is about creating a full-stack application and showcasing the HTML, CSS, JS and Python skills I have attained over the past 10 months at Code Institute. It is deployed on Heroku and the fourth out of five projects.  

# Schlosskulm Rental Apartments

I chose to create this application because I know the apartment hosts personally and have visited their charming location in Schlosskulm, Germany. Next to their apartment offer on AirBnB they also needed a proper homepage so I offered my services. I am extra motivated because I know that the project will actually be of real-life use once completed. It is a great way of doing first steps in client work to visualize an idea together and work on the desired features. As the hosts live in rural Germany and the expected guests will mostly be German-speaking the homepage is created in German.
